All the other books mentioned below should\nalso stay on plan and have more Came] and Kamel impact  By\nleaving these books I am\nonly raising Marlboro's share of voice.\nIwill be fired or I should quit if\nYork share\nfor Camel and Kamel does not grow. I have to have better, more impactful advertising:\nSalem has &\nchallenge ahead; but the ONLY\nthat wil] work for Salem is\nhaving more impactful creative. Having Mela\nAlem on billboards and POS means\nnothing along with the ORB which has no equity. To suggest taking the foot off the pedal\nfor Camel and Winston with strong equities to make room for Mela\nAlem and the Orb is\nabsolutly wrong: New York if anything needs more Camel impact,\nFrom: Ittermann; Patti F.\nTo: OBrien; J.
