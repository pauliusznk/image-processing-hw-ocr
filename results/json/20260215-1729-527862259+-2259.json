Also, at least three cily\ncouncil members (two plus the mayor) have agreed t0 rescind the city's\nordinances on smoking to make way for whatever the health department\ndccides: Two councilors are undecided: The other four are against allowing thc\nhealth department enact a smoking ban. The public health commissioner\nfeels an agreement will be reached between the restaurants and the health\ndepartment. However; no matter what that agreement is this time, he thinks\nthe town will ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the very near future:\nTo help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board,\nBob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to\nthe city council and the board,\nSolano County, Calif:\nOn 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to\nban smoking outside the entraces of county building;\n8\n8\nrjr4059318\n70003 4811\nTilley;\nHoy;",
