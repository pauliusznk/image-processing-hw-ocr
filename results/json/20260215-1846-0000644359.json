    "content": "People may not- be practicing what on health care. By Georgla Dullea Many are finding it harder to cope with the cost of medical and dental care for themselves or their families (36 percent). Others have cut back in some way, such as by eating more calories but fewer nutrients; counting fat grams instead of servings per day. Most Americans agree that health insurance is a good idea medically the middle aged and those with chronic conditions are most likely to benefit from it (42 percent). Yet almost half say they can't afford private coverage, even though every third American family has at least one member who smokes or drinks alcohol excessively. Most Americans want their government to do more about health care issues such as obesity and access for the uninsured but don't necessarily agree on how best to achieve this (48 percent).",
