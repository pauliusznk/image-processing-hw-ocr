Let Maura know.\n\nOriginal Message--From: Byron Nclson [SMTP:bnelson @ wka.com]Sent: Monday, August 03, 1998 4.27 PMTo: Judy Albert; Carolyn; Jackie Cohen (AWMA); Frank; Goody; Henry; Hollant; Chris Holt; Hurst; Jim; Joe; John; Benjamin Kelahan; Cheryl Klein; Wall Klein; Lbeckwith; Rob Meyne; Mkatz; Morrow; Powers; Randy; Roger; Ron; Suggsm; Matthew whitey\nCc: JohnBob Stone\nSubject: Morning Team Notes 8/4\nCambridge, MA\nAlthough the health department wants to pursue a complete ban on smoking in restaurants and bars they appear willing to listen arguments from Restaurant owners. Also at least three city council members (two plus the mayor) have agreed to rescind the city's ordinances on smoking, but two are undecided: The other four are against allowing health department enact a smoking ban.\n\nTo help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board,\nBob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to city council and the board. On 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to ban smoking outside the entrances of county building.\n\nOn: August 03, 1998 at 4:27 PMBob Stone\nSMTP:bnelson@wka.com"
